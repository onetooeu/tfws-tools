# Non-authoritative policy

TFWS Tools provide convenience and diagnostics only.

They:
- generate files for users to publish on their own domains
- validate files against schemas
- check endpoint availability and basic correctness

They do NOT:
- certify a domain
- grant trust
- assign trust scores
- act as a registry or authority

Trust remains self-declared and independently verifiable.
